    <h1> Window Object Vs Document Object in JavaScript</h1>

    <h2> Window Object </h2>
    <p>
        The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript,
         representing the browser window containing a DOM document and
          acting as the root of the document object model.
    </p>

<p>
The window object, supported by all browsers, 
represents the browser’s window and automatically includes 
global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables as members.

The Window object is responsible for managing global variables,
functions, and objects, providing methods for browser interaction
and managing properties related to frames, tabs, or windows,
such as alert(), confirm(), setTimeout(), and setInterval().
</p>
    
<h2>
    Document Object
</h2>
<p>
   
The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves
 as an interface for interacting with the web page’s content. The browser generates a 
 Document Object Model of a web page upon loading it.

The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform-neutral interface that
 enables dynamic access and updating of a document’s content, structure, and style by programs and scripts.

The DOM is a logical tree in a document, with methods allowing programmatic access 
to change its structure, style, or content.
